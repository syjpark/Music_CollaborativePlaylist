# Final project

Starter code for your final project.

## General points

- for folder and file names: 
	+ don't use white space in either folder or filenames, use an underscore "_" instead
	+ (almost always) use lower case only
- always use relative paths in your code
	+ for example, to save a figure from an R script inside the `code/R/` folder the path should be "../../figures/figure_name.pdf"
- keep your folder structure organized
	+ we recommend adhering to the folder structure in this repository 
	+ more complex projects may have additional folders such as `videos/`, `papers/`, ...
- note: some of the folders are empty except for a `.keep` file
	+ the `.keep` file is just there to make sure that github includes the otherwise empty folder 
	+ feel free to delete the `.keep` file once you've added another file to that folder

## Repository structure 

```
├── code
│   └── R
├── data
├── figures
├── papers
├── presentation
└── writeup
    ├── final_report
    └── proposal
```

### code 

Put all your code here. If you are using another programming language for some of your coding, add a separate folder here for that language. For example, you could add a `python/` folder for any python scripts that you're using. 

#### R 

Make sure to put all the R scripts and RMarkdown scripts into this folder. It already contains a RMarkdown template for the project proposal.

### data 

Put your raw data file here. Any data wrangling to that file should happen in your R script. Feel free to remove the `poker.csv` data set in this folder. 

### figures 

Save all your figures here. You may want to include additional subfolder here such as `plots/`, `diagrams/` etc. Feel free to remove the `example_figure.pdf` in that folder. 

### papers 

Put research papers here that are relevant for your project. 

### presentation

Put your project presentation here (e.g. your keynote, powerpoint, google slides, or pdf file).

### writeup 

Put all your writing here. This folder structure is likely to expand for more complex projects. For example, you could add a subfolders like folders `journal/jpsp/submission/`, `journal/jpsp/resubmission/` etc. 

#### final_report 

The pdf of your final report should go here. 

#### proposal 

The pdf of your project proposal should go here.
