# Collaborative Playlist Analyses

The content in this repository are analyses on the collaborative playlist (CP) survey. 

### The survey
The CP survey was created based on findings from ethnography and direct observations of CP users (N=10). <br />
The preliminary work can be found here: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/meri/assets/pdf/park2017ISMIR_LBD.pdf


The survey aims to understand the landscape of CP usage, how CP usage correlates with various perceptions (e.g., music's role in social connectedness), as well as the usage patterns of CPs. <br />
*We are currently conducting the CP survey to understand multi-cultural implications of CP usage.* <br />

More work has stemmed out of this survey and will be presented at ISMIR in November 2019. <br />
The pre-print for this can be found here: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/meri/assets/pdf/park2019cameraReady.pdf


This survey is part of a larger study on collaborative music platforms that I am leading.


### The data
The data analyzed here was collected over two months: January and February 2019.


### The analysis
The analysis was conducted during the first two weeks of March 2019 for PSYCH 252: Statistical Methods. <br />
Classmates Alexa Siu and So Yeon Park both contributed towards the analyses equally.
